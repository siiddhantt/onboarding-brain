# Architecture Decision Records

Short notes on decisions that shaped this codebase, and why. They exist so you
can tell a considered choice from an accident, and so you know what you are
breaking if you change one.

Records are immutable once accepted. If a decision is reversed, add a new
record that supersedes the old one rather than editing history.

Format follows [Michael Nygard's](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
lightweight template: context, decision, consequences.
